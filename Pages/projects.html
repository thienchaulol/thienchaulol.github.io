                Puppy Party is a very small project that I had the pleasure to work on. It is a mobile clicker app for Android/iOS. I used Unity3D to create the game and coded the scripts for the game using C#.<br>
                When the game starts, you can accumulate treats by clicking on the screen. When you have enough treats, you can upgrade your "treats per tap" or purchase a dog that accumulates treats every second. Once you have a dog, you can make your dog even cuter by purchasing accessories!<br>

                LED Tower Defense was my final project for my CS120B Intro to Embedded Systems class. I coded my project using Atmel Studio 7(C++) and the Arduino IDE(C). The Atmel Studio code was uploaded to my ATMega1284 microcontroller and the Arduino IDE code was uploaded to my Arduino Uno.<br> 
                The code on the ATMega1284 dealt with the game logic, LCD display, user input, cursor movement and communication with the Arduino Uno.<br>
                The code on the Arduino Uno dealt with the LEDs on the 16x32 LED Matrix and communication with the ATmega1284.<br>

                In this project, I used search algorithms and C++ to create an 8-puzzle solver. I coded three algorithms: Uniform Cost Search, A* with the Misplaced Tile Heuristic, and A* with the Manhattan Distance Heuristic.<br>
                To start off, I stored the initial 8-puzzle in a struct named "node", in the node I stored the puzzle as a 2D vector of doubles. The node has node-pointers to it's children which are previous moves of the puzzle. For every search algorithm, new nodes are created based on possible moves, the nodes are pushed onto a queue, and the program would evaluate possible moves on each node at the front of the queue. This process is repeated recursively until a solution is found.<br>
                <b><u>Uniform Cost Search</u></b>: checks every move at every "level" in the "tree" to see if it is a solution to the 8-puzzle.

                The quickest algorithm was A* with the Manhattan Distance Heuristic and the slowest was Uniform Cost Search.
