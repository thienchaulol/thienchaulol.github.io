                <p><em>These are the two games I play most frequently</em></p>
                <li>League of Legends(MOBA)</li>
                    <p style="margin-left:20px">League of Legends is the main game I play in my free time. I started playing League of Legends in my junior year of highschool (Season 2, 2013) and have played every season since then. I've had a lot of great experiences playing League of Legends and it has shaped my personality and shown me many morals.</p>
                <li>Minecraft(MMORPG)</li>
                    <p style="margin-left:20px">I started playing Minecraft in middle school and still play every now and then. Minecraft has always been a fun and fulfilling game for me to play solo or with my friends. In order to play with friends, I would join populated Minecraft servers and we would choose minigames to play or my group of friends would set up a Minecraft server and start our world.</p>
                <p><em>The list goes on..</em></p>
