                <h1 class="page__title">About Me</h1>
                <p>In 2014, I started the path to my Computer Science degree at the University of California, Riverside. I lived in Downtown Los Angeles during my education and commuted to UCR daily by taking the Metrolink’s 91 Line back and forth. Everyday I’d pack the necessary food and school supplies needed for that day. In 2018, I successfully completed my engineering program and received my B.S. in Computer Science.</p>
                <p>During my second year at the University of California, Riverside, I was a Peer Leader with the E.N.S.U.R.E program at the Bourns College of Engineering. As a Peer Leader, I was assigned 9 first year engineering students and guided them with weekly individualized time management and academic counseling sessions. I also arranged and led bi-weekly conferences with all 9 students to foster teamwork and partnership. In the final week of their program, we competed in a competitive hack-a-thon where they manufactured a C++ Space Invader Program under my supervision.</p>
                <p>In my third year, I took on a personal project relating to mobile application development. I chose to create a rudimentary Android iOS video game application. I did research on Android development and worked on the project during the gaps in between my classes. The application is an early incremental game where the player taps for points to purchase upgrades.</p>
                <p>My time at UCR has left me with great time management, communication, organizational, and problem-solving skills as well as a deep understanding of mathematics, physics, and computer science. I’m looking to continue polishing these skills and helping others learn.</p>
