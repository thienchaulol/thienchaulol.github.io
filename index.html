        <h3>About Me</h3>
        My full name is Thien Duc Chau and I am a third year Computer Science major attending the University of California, Riverside. I am expected to finish my Bachelor Degree program in the Spring of 2018. In my free time, I like to develop software or play video games. To develop, I use Unity3D and code my scripts in C#. As for video games, I am a PC-user and play mainly League of Legends. I enjoy League of Legends a lot and it has been my go-to game for the past few years.

        <h4>Playing Video Games</h4>
            <ul>
                <p><em>These are the two games I play most frequently</em></p>
                <li>League of Legends(MOBA)</li>
                    <p style="margin-left:20px">League of Legends is the main game I play in my free time. I started playing League of Legends in my junior year of highschool (Season 2, 2013) and have played every season since then. I've had a lot of great experiences playing League of Legends and it has shaped my personality and shown me many morals.</p>
                <li>Minecraft(MMORPG)</li>
                    <p style="margin-left:20px">I started playing Minecraft in middle school and still play every now and then. Minecraft has always been a fun and fulfilling game for me to play solo or with my friends. In order to play with friends, I would join populated Minecraft servers and we would choose minigames to play or my group of friends would set up a Minecraft server and start our world.</p>
