											<h2>The Journey</h2>
										</header>
										<p>
											In 2014, I had began my journey with Computer Science at the University of California, Riverside. From 2014 to 2018, I had worked as an engineering student peer leader, student researcher, and independent software developer. I worked with the Bourns College of Engineering as a peer leader to guide students in their first years as engineers. I worked as a student researcher to develop Python scripts which monitored power consumption. And I worked as an independent developer to create a mobile app in Unity. I graduated from the University of California, Riverside in 2018 and received my B.S. in Computer Science. Shortly after graduating, I pursued a career in education whilst pursuing my passions for software development in my leisure time.
										</p>
										<p>
											I started my education career in 2018 with Franklin Educational Services in Brentwood, Los Angeles CA. I admired their focus on student growth as individuals and their approach to learning. I am still with Franklin Educational as of 2021 and look to help students learn whenever possible. To me, education quickly turned into an attractive field and I began teaching at Fusion Academy, Pasadena in their unique 1 to 1 learning environment. The lessons I learned teaching at Fusion were truly invaluable to me and really shaped the educator that I am today. After working for Fusion for 2 years from 2018 to 2020, I looked to expand my horizons and teach a larger classroom. I am now working with Convent and Stuart Hall in San Francisco for the foreseeable future year as their AP/IB Computer Science teacher.

										<h3><a href="https://github.com/thienchaulol/Puppy-Party">Puppy Party</a></h3>
										<p>Puppy Party is a very small project that I had the pleasure to work on. It is a mobile clicker app for Android/iOS. I used Unity3D to create the game and coded the scripts for the game using C#.
When the game starts, you can accumulate treats by clicking on the screen. When you have enough treats, you can upgrade your "treats per tap" or purchase a dog that accumulates treats every second. Once you have a dog, you can make your dog even cuter by purchasing accessories!</p>
