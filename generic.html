								<h2>Puppy Party</h2>
								<p>Puppy Party is a very small project that I had the pleasure to work on. It is a mobile clicker app for Android/iOS. I used Unity3D to create the game and coded the scripts for the game using C#.
When the game starts, you can accumulate treats by clicking on the screen. When you have enough treats, you can upgrade your "treats per tap" or purchase a dog that accumulates treats every second. Once you have a dog, you can make your dog even cuter by purchasing accessories!</p>

								<h2>Intro to Embedded Systems Project (CS120B at UCR)</h2>
								<p>LED Tower Defense was my final project for my CS120B Intro to Embedded Systems class. I coded my project using Atmel Studio 7(C++) and the Arduino IDE(C). The Atmel Studio code was uploaded to my ATMega1284 microcontroller and the Arduino IDE code was uploaded to my Arduino Uno.
The code on the ATMega1284 dealt with the game logic, LCD display, user input, cursor movement and communication with the Arduino Uno.
The code on the Arduino Uno dealt with the LEDs on the 16x32 LED Matrix and communication with the ATmega1284.</p>

                                <h2>Computer Networks Project (CS164 at UCR)
</h2>
                                <p>In Computer Networks, we explored multiple data transfer protocols. One that I'd like to showcase is my version of a client-server model utilizing the Selective Repeat data transfer protocol.
In this model, the client would interact with the server by sending "packets" of data that were strings. In each program, I created sockets for the two nodes to transfer data between and encapsulated packet checking, packet sending, and packet corruption instructions in an always true while loop. For packet checking, the client and server would each keep track of individual sequence numbers in the packets and I also attached a checksum to each packet for packet corruption checking. The packets were delivered using socket functions from the "socket" library in Python. The server could reject any sequence number packet and accept out-of-order sequence numbered packets and buffer them. The client individually retransmits unacknowledged packets that have timed out.</p>
                                <h2>Intro to Artificial Intelligence Project (CS170 at UCR)
</h2>
                                <p>In this project, I used search algorithms and C++ to create an 8-puzzle solver. I coded three algorithms: Uniform Cost Search, A* with the Misplaced Tile Heuristic, and A* with the Manhattan Distance Heuristic.
To start off, I stored the initial 8-puzzle in a struct named "node", in the node I stored the puzzle as a 2D vector of doubles. The node has node-pointers to it's children which are previous moves of the puzzle. For every search algorithm, new nodes are created based on possible moves, the nodes are pushed onto a queue, and the program would evaluate possible moves on each node at the front of the queue. This process is repeated recursively until a solution is found.</p>
                                <p>
                                    <b><u>Uniform Cost Search</u></b>: checks every move at every "level" in the "tree" to see if it is a solution to the 8-puzzle.

                                <p>
                                    <b><u>A* with the Misplaced Tile Heuristic</u></b>: checks the amount of misplaced tiles the current puzzle has compared to the solution and enqueues the node leading to the least amount of misplaced tiles from the solution.
                                        <a href="https://i.imgur.com/OM7ZhIC.png">ASTARMIS_0</a>

                                <p>
                                        <b><u>A* with the Manhattan Distance Heuristic</u></b>: adds up the distance from each of the tiles to it's solution's position and enqueues the node leading to the least total distance from the solution.<br>
                                        The quickest algorithm was A* with the Manhattan Distance Heuristic and the slowest was Uniform Cost Search.
